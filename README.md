# Egit-test-hashmaps
HashMaps – Anagrams
Create a method that reads words from a file, one per line, and stores them in an Array.
Create a method that takes a String as a parameter, and returns a sorted version of the string back. (bac->abc)
Using these methods and a HashMap, perform the following;
Find the word that has the most anagrams located in the list
If two words have the same amount of anagrams, output the word that is longer.
If two words have the same length and the same amount of anagrams, output both.

Email your lecturer to get access to the wordlist once your code is ready. Until then create your own text file to test it on.
Hint – The key will be the sorted word, the value will be an arraylist of the anagrams found.
